# Learn react / reactjs, the UI library from Instagram Facebook, fast !

If you are already programming in JavaScript, or a node wiz, picking up [react](https://github.com/facebook/react) will take no time at all.

Try [React: Create maintainable, high-performance UI components](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-react-intro/index.html)  and you will be creating flexible, composable, future-proof user interfaces this afternoon.

![React helps you to create web UIs with composable, high performance components that can be easily reused and extended. ](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-react-intro/figure5.jpg)
React is designed from ground-up for the inevitable end-to-end asynchronous pipeline that all web and mobile apps are evolving to.  It also incorporates elements of best practices for handling large JavaScript projects/team, directly from Instagram and Facebook's own experience.

If you are doing mobile-ready production work, you may want to check out [material-ui](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui), an evolving yet highly functional theme-consistent component library that you can deploy today. Read [Create an IBM Watson explorer with React](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-watson-explorer-react-app/index.html) to try an example app created using material-ui.

Once you're comfortable with react, start creating your own native iOS or Android app with [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native).  Everything you learn here will work (or work even better, as some have claimed) for creating JavaScript driven native mobile apps!

The only question remaining may be:  

>Why didn't we start using react sooner?
